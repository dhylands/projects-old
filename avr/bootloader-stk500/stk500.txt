    Note that there are no spaces between switches and their parameters
    and that hexadecimal values do not have a '0x' prefix.

Parameters:
d   Device name. For a list of supported devices use STK500.EXE -?
m   Select programming mode; serial (s) or parallel/high-voltage (p).
    Serial mode is the default mode if this parameter is ommitted.
if  Name of FLASH input file. Required for programming or verification
    of the FLASH memory. The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
ie  Name of EEPROM input file. Required for programming or verification
    of the EEPROM memory. The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
of  Name of flash output file. Required for readout of the FLASH memory.
    The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
oe  Name of EEPROM output file. Required for readout of the EEPROM
    memory. The file format is Intel Extended HEX.
s   Read signature bytes.
O   Read oscillator callibration byte. 'address' is the address of the
    calibration byte as decribed in the data sheet of the device.
Sf  Write oscillator call. byte to FLASH memory. 'addr' is byte address
Se  Write oscillator call. byte to EEPROM memory. 'addr' is byte address
e   Erase device. If applied with another programming parameter, the
    device will be erased before any other programming takes place.
p   Program device; FLASH (f), EEPROM (e) or both (b). Corresponding
    input files are required.
r   Read out device; FLASH (f), EEPROM (e) or both (b). Corresponding
    output files are required
v   Verify device; FLASH (f), EEPROM (e) or both (b). Can be used with
    -p or stand alone. Corresponding input files are required.
l   Set lock byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value.
L   Verify lock byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value to verify against.
y   Read back lock byte.
f   Set fuse bytes. 'value' is a 16-bit hex. value describing the
    settings for the upper and lower fuse.
E   Set extended fuse byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value describing the
    extend fuse settings.
F   Verify fuse bytes. 'value' is a 16-bit hex. value to verify against.
G   Verify extended fuse byte. 'value' is an 8-bit hex. value describing
    the extend fuse settings.
q   Read back fuse bytes.
af  FLASH address range. Specifies the address range of operations. The
    default is the entire FLASH. Addresses are byte oriented.
ae  EEPROM address range. Specifies the address range of operations.
    The default is the entire EEPROM. Byte addresses.
Y   Perform the oscillator calibration sequence. See appnote AVR053 for more
    information.
Z   Loads a value from an EEPROM location prior to chip erase which then
    can be programmed into FLASH or EEPROM using the S option. Address is
    a hex value. See appnote AVR053 for more information.
c   Select communication port; 'com1' to 'com8'. If this parameter is
    ommitted the program will scan the comm. ports for the STK500
ut  Set target voltage VTARGET in Volts. 'value' is a floating point
    value between 0.0 and 6.0, describing the new voltage.
ua  Set adjustable voltage AREF in Volts. 'value' is a floating point
    value between 0.0 and 6.0, describing the new voltage.
wt  Get current target voltage VTARGET.
wa  Get current adjustable voltage AREF.
Wt  Verify that VTARGET is within 5% of the given value. 'value' is a
    floating point value between 0.0 and 6.0.
b   Get revisions; hardware revision (h) and software revision (s).
!   Set oscillator frequency; 'freq' can be whole Hz, or kHz or MHz
t   Get oscillator frequency.
I   Set ISP frequency; 'freq' can be whole Hz, or kHz or MHz
J   Get ISP frequency.
g   Silent operation.
z   Not used. Supported for backwards compability.
h   Help information (overrides all other settings)
