This file documents what I would do to setup a new computer with my preferred
command line environment. Feel free to customize as appropriate.

Goto http://www.cygwin.com/ and install cygwin
I use the following:
    - install from Internet
    - Root Directory: c:\cygwin
    - Install for All Users
    - Default Text File Type: Unix/binary
    - Local Package directory:
        c:\cygwin\Download
    - I use ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/
    
I install the following packages in addition to the default:

    Archive
        unzip
        zip
    Devel
        binutils
        bison
        flex
        gcc
        make
        subversion
    Editors
        gvim
        vim
    Graphics
        exif
        GrpahicsMagick
        ImageMagick
    Interpreters
        perl
    Net
        inetutils
        netcat
        ping
        whois
    Perl
        perl_manpages
    Shells
        bash_completion
    Text
        enscript
    Utils
        file
        patch
    Web
        wget
        
I then modify the cygwin icon so that instead of having a target of:
    C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat 
    
it contains:
    C:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe --login -i
    

I create the directory c:\Home and make the HOME environment variable point
to that location.

I create single letter directories for each of my drives and mount the drives
on them:
    mkdir /c /d
    mount c: /c
    mount d: /d
    
    mkdir /MyDocuments
    mount c:/MyDocuments /MyDocuments
    
Edit the home directory in /etc/passwd (c:\cygwin\etc\passwd) for your userid to be
    /c/Home
    
rather than 
    /home/dhylands
    
cd ~
svn co http://svn.hylands.org/ projects
cd projects/bash
./isntall.sh

Exit from the current cygwin shell and start a new one. You should have a
green prompt.

I also normally click on the System Menu (top corner of your command line prompt)
Under the Layout tab:
    Set Screen Buffer Size Width to 160 
    Set Screen Buffer Size Height to 999
    Set Window Size Width to 160

Under the Options tab:
    Ensure QuickEdit mode and Insert Mode are set
    
Note; Quick Edit mode allows you to hilight text with the cursor (using a mouse).
Pressing Enter copies the hilighted text into the clipboard. Pressing the right
mouse button pastes the text.
        
Click OK and choose "Modify shortcut which started this window" to make the
changes permanent.
