# getdiff.sh:
#
# A simple shell script to find the difference between the given
# file, say, "foo/bar" and "foo/bar.orig". The output is a 
# "diff -u2N" context difference preceded by "Index: " and "===="
# lines somewhat similar to that output by CVS. 
#
# This output can be treated as a patch against the original 
# file (without the ".orig" suffix) to convert it to the given 
# file like this:
#
#     patch -p0 < output-from-this-script
